=================

XDispatch provides the power of Grand Central Dispatch not only on Mac OS 10.6+
but also on Windows and Linux. The XDispatch framework consists of three libraries:
 * libdispatch
 * libxdispatch
 * libqtdispatch

This repository contains a mirror of the trunk and the stable branch of the
XDispatch subversion repository located at http://opensource.mlba-team.de/svn/xdispatch.

Feel free to fork it and change it as you like. We always welcome any bugfixes or
improvements to our current code base.
